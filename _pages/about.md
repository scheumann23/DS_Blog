I am Neelan Scheumann and I'm currently a Data Scientist at OneAmerica Financial Partners in Indianapolis, IN. I am also currently a student at Indiana University Bloomington in the Masters of Science in Data Science program. I've recently begin reading the book "Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch" and, as recommended, I have decided to start blogging about what I am learning as I make my way through the book. I'm not sure how this will go, but hopefully it helps to reinforce everything that I am learning and in the slim event someone else manages to stumble onto this website, perhaps it might benefit them as well.
