I am Neelan Scheumann and I'm currently a Data Scientist at OneAmerica Financial Partners in Indianapolis, IN. I am also currently a student at Indiana University Bloomington in the Masters of Science in Data Science program. This website will initially serve as a protfolio of projects that I have worked on throughout my time at IU. As I continue to build out content I also plan to include blog posts around different topics in the machine learning/deep learning/AI space.
